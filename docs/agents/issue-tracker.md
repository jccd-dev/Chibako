# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file
- Comments and conversation history append under a `## Comments` heading

## Publishing

When a skill says “publish to the issue tracker,” create a file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`, creating the directory if needed.

## Fetching

Read the referenced local issue file. The user will normally provide its path or number.
